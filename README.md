**minecraft_ros2** is a MOD that integrates Minecraft with ROS 2. It allows Minecraft world data—such as player position and block states—to be published to ROS 2, enabling visualization in RViz2 and potential interaction from ROS 2 nodes.

This repository contains the source code for the MOD and provides a foundation for experiments and research involving Minecraft and robotics middleware.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 22.04
* Minecraft (Java Edition)
* ROS 2 Humble or later
* [ros2\_java](https://github.com/minecraft-ros2/ros2_java)

## 🚢 Quick Start with Docker

Docker provides a convenient way to try out the environment in this repository. Follow the steps below to get started.

> **⚠️ Prerequisites**
> Docker must be installed, and you need to configure your host to share GUI applications (e.g., using `xhost`).

### Steps

1. **Allow GUI Access**

   ```bash
   xhost +local:root
   ```

2. **Make shared directory**

   Run this step only once during the initial setup.
   ```bash
   docker volume create minecraft_ros2_gradle_cache
   mkdir -p ~/.minecraft
   ```

3. **Start the Docker Container**

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
     --env="DISPLAY=$DISPLAY" \
     --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
     --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
     --mount source=minecraft_ros2_gradle_cache,target=/root/.gradle \
     -v ~/.minecraft:/ws/minecraft_ros2/run \
     ghcr.io/minecraft-ros2/minecraft_ros2:latest \
     /bin/bash ./runClient.sh
   ```

   * If you want to use the GPU, add `--gpus all` (requires NVIDIA Container Toolkit):

4. **Verify Operation with Tools like `rviz2`**
   
   Once ROS 2 is running inside the container, you can start tools like `rviz2` from another terminal to visualize the data.

5. **Restore permissions**
   ```bash
   xhost -local:root
   ```
