# Minecraft\_ros2

[æ—¥æœ¬èªž](README_JP.md)

**minecraft_ros2** is a MOD that integrates Minecraft with ROS 2. It allows Minecraft world dataâ€”such as player position and block statesâ€”to be published to ROS 2, enabling visualization in RViz2 and potential interaction from ROS 2 nodes.

This repository contains the source code for the MOD and provides a foundation for experiments and research involving Minecraft and robotics middleware.
