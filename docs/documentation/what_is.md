# Introduction to Minecraft ROS 2

**minecraft\_ros2** is a MOD that integrates Minecraft with ROS 2.
By publishing world data from Minecraft (e.g., player position, block states, etc.) to ROS 2, you can visualize it in RViz2 and interact with other ROS 2 nodes.
This repository contains the source code for the MOD, making it a useful foundation for research and experimentation in robot middleware using Minecraft.

## How to Set Up
