# RViz2
Rviz is a 3D visualizer included with ROS (Robot Operating System).

By using Rviz, you can visualize data such as player information, LiDAR, and camera data in 3D space.

## Launch
```bash
rviz2
```
That's all it takes (assuming `source` has already been executed).

## Configuration
Here we will visualize Image and LiDAR data.
(Please ensure `minecraft_ros2` is running)

### Image
Image refers to images, and the Minecraft gameplay screen is being sent.

From the bottom left corner of the screen, click Add and select Image by topic.

Then the Minecraft screen will be displayed in the bottom left corner!

### LiDAR
By [equipping a LiDAR sensor](/documentation/doc_sensors), you can determine the distance to surrounding blocks and entities.

Just like with Image, select Point Cloud 2 by topic.

You might expect something to appear, but nothing changes.

That's because the coordinate frame being displayed is incorrect.

By changing the Global Options' Fixed Frame to `player`, the data will be displayed.

If itâ€™s hard to see, you can adjust the Size (m) of Point Cloud 2 to make it easier to view.
